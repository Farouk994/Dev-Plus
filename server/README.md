### Tips

1. You are able to clone this repo or download a zip file to your local machine.
2. If you have cloned a repo and a package.json exists, you are able to see the dependencies and dev dependencies used in the application. If this is the case run the below command to get all the dependencies need for that application. Open client and "npm i" and the server as well

```
$ npm i
```
3. Regarding CORS, i have added the origin of the client side (browser) in the server, so technically you need to run both instances of the server and client in order to access client resources and also access server responses and requests

4. In order to run application after cloning the repo run 

### For Server directory run :
```
npm start  
```
### For Client directory run :
```
npm start  
```
